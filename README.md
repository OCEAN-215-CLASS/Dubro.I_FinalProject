# Dubro.I_FinalProject
My project looks into the iceberg distribution and location over a 50 year difference (1950 and 2020) to see if there is any change present due to changes in the climate in the past several decades. I used two datasets which both recorded iceberg locations and plotted these coordinates on a scatter map. 

Important Note: In Github the scatter geo plots don't show up on the ipynb file so I attached each plot as an png. file.
